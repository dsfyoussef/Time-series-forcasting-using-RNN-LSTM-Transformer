Time series forcasting using RNN&amp;LSTM&amp;Transformer

This repository contains an implementation of stock price prediction using various deep learning models, including Transformers, Simple RNN, and Bidirectional LSTM. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using real-world stock price data.

*Features:

-Data Preprocessing: Includes scaling, splitting into training and test sets, and dataset preparation for time-series models.
-Transformer Model: Implements a custom transformer encoder for stock price prediction.
-Simple RNN Model: A simple RNN model trained for sequential data.
-Bidirectional LSTM Model: A robust LSTM-based model utilizing bidirectional layers for improved performance.
-Visualization: Generates plots to visualize the results of predictions and evaluation metrics. 
-Evaluation Metrics: Includes RMSE, MSE, and MAE for model performance evaluation.
-Dataset:The dataset used in this project is Google's stock price data (GOOGL.csv). You can find this dataset in the repository under the /data folder.

*Requirements
To run this project, you need the following libraries installed:
-Python 3.x
-Pandas
-NumPy
-scikit-learn
